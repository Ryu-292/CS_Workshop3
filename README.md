# CS_Workshop3

The goal of my game is to crush rabbits called 'Opanchu Usagi' with a hammer by pressing the SPACE key. Rabbits appear randomly, with a delay ranging from 500 to 2000 milliseconds.

You start with 3 lives. If you successfully crush a rabbit, you earn 5 points. If you press the SPACE key without a rabbit present, you lose 2 points. Missing a rabbit costs you a life.

Every 50 points, the game speed increases. If you lose all 3 lives, the game is over. After the game ends, you can either restart or view the leaderboard to compare your score with others.
Additionally, a graph is generated at the end, showing all scores.
